This code just get site urls from google search.
It works very simple and has no detail.
You can run it by filling in the text and count fields. If you send too many queries in a row, google can block you. And in this case, you will not be able to process a few hours. The data returns as json, you can take it as an array if you want. All you have to do is turn off json_encode.
